    "Last week we looked at a realistic, biophysical model of the neuron's membrane voltage, the dynamics of which can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "One route we can take with such models is to increase their realism by adding currents and compartments that correspond to the channels expressed by real neurons, and to their spatially elaborated morphology. This realism comes at the cost of more parameters and variables, which take more computational power to simulate and which can be difficult to constrain with experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another route, which we will take today, is to look for general principles of neural dynamics that are independent of the specific channels and their spatial distribution. In other words, what can we learn about neurons by studying them through the mathematical formalism of **dynamical systems**?\n",

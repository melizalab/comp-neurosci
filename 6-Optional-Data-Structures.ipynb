    "\n",
    "We've encountered a number of different Python data types so far. We've seen **atomic** data types like `int` and `float`, which are just single values, and we've seen **aggregate** data types like `list`, `tuple`, `str`, and `np.array` which can contain more than one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What all of the aggregate types we've covered so far have in common is that they are indexed by number. We can access individual elements by numerical index (e.g. `my_array[0]`) and subsets of the sequence by slicing (e.g. `my_array[2:20]`). We saw how arrays can have more than one dimension, which then means we can access rows, columns, and various other kinds of subsets based on a combination of indices and slices (e.g. `col = my_array[:,0]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that some kinds of aggregates support **nesting**. For example, point process data are usually represented by *lists of lists* or *lists of arrays*. Accessing elements of these data structures also requires multiple indices, but with some differences in syntax (e.g. `first_spike = trials[0][0]`)."

You really only have the option of creating another object or changing how the data are represented. With `itemdict` and `itemlist`, because each element is a dict, you can easily add new key/value pairs as your understanding of the problem changes.

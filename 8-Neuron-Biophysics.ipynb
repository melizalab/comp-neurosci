    "Let's review what we've covered so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "We've worked a lot with **rate models**, which are based on a fairly abstract concept of neurons as integrators. The power of this approach is in its simplicity. Because rate models are (mostly) linear, we can intuitively understand what they are doing, and we can usually fit the models to real data using standard, well-understood statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then spent some time with **decoding models**, which are also rather abstract in that they only seek to understand the probabilistic relationship between stimulus and response, without necessarily invoking an intervening model of how spikes are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are going to dive into a more realistic view of how neurons work. As you might expect, this increased realism comes at the cost of more complexity. Sometimes it is worth it, and sometimes it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by discussing the electrical dynamics of neurons, and then work our way into the mathematics of dynamical systems.\n",
    "\n",

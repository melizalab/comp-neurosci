    "One route we can take with such models is to increase their realism by adding currents and compartments that correspond to the channels expressed by real neurons, and to their spatially elaborated morphology. This realism comes at the cost of more parameters and variables, which take more computational power to simulate and which can be difficult to constrain with experimental data.\n",

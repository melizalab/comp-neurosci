## Course Description

To survive and reproduce in a complex and variable physical world, animals have
to extract information from sensory inputs, make decisions about how to allocate
their resources, and perform tightly choreographed sequences of motor behaviors.
Brains have evolved to perform these tasks reliably, flexibly, and efficiently.
**Our goal is to understand how these computations are implemented by circuits
of neurons**.

The challenge we face is that brains themselves are enormously complex. Even
relatively "simple" non-human animals have millions of neurons and billions of
connections. Just observing a small fraction of the brain in action can generate
enormous quantities of data. Voltage from an intracellular electrode is sampled
40,000 times a second, and EEGs are recorded on 19 channels sampled up to 2,000
times a second. That means almost 2.5 million data points in one minute! With so
much data, how can we possibly find the information in all the noise?

The approach we'll use here is **computational modeling**, which means building
toy systems that capture some aspect of how a particular system in the brain is
performing its function. As we'll discuss, there are many different kinds of
models and ways of building them, but one of the most useful functions of a
model is that it can be used like a lens that can reveal structure in our data
and help us filter out the noise.

This course will introduce you to foundational principles of computational
modeling in the brain using a hands-on approach with exercises that will also
build your expertise in using scientific programming to implement models and
apply them to real-world data.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

- identify different types of neuroscience data and the appropriate methods for analyzing them
- understand linear time series models and how to use them to analyze and predict neural activity
- use Python and its numerical libraries to process, analyze, and visualize neuroscience data
- think through computational problems logically and outline the steps of an analysis
- work as part of a team to write and talk about computational research
- feel confident in your ability to use computers in your research and find resources to answer future questions

## Course Schedule

This schedule is subject to change based on the interests of the class and our progress through the material, and some readings have yet to be chosen. If there's something you want to cover that isn't listed, let me know! In general, Tuesdays will be used for lecture-based instruction, and Thursdays for in-class work. Readings must be completed before class on Tuesday. Assignment instructions can be found on Collab and must be submitted before class on Tuesday the following week.

## Materials

### Computing requirements

Scientific programming is essential to computational neuroscience. Digital computers are extremely good at doing the same thing over and over again, which is exactly what we need to reliably deal with the big data generated in neuroscience. In fact, everyone who works with data can benefit from being able to hand tedious tasks off to a computer. Scientific programming is an important skill for researchers at all levels, and the practice of programming will help you learn how to break down complex problems of all kinds into a set of logical steps.

Anyone who is interested in developing these skills is welcome to take the class regardless of programming experience. (Seriously!) You do need to be committed to learning these essential skills, however, which may require significant out-of-class work to nail down core concepts if you are totally new to this. I can direct you to useful tutorials and other materials as needed.

Laptops are necessary for this class. You will need to bring your laptop, running Linux, OS X, or Windows, to every class meeting. Almost all the work will be performed in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks running the Python interpreter. We will spend time on the first day of class making sure everyone has a functioning environment.

### Readings

There is no textbook for the course, but reviews and readings from the primary literature will be assigned throughout the semester. PDF copies will be shared through the Resources tab on the class Collab page.

## Evaluation

### Engagement (40%)

Due to the fact that we complete much of the work in class, attendance is critical. Unless otherwise arranged with the instructor, you may only miss one class without penalty. If you are unable to attend class in person due to a COVID-related isolation or quarantine, notify the instructor so that you can attend via zoom. Additional absences may be excused due to religious holidays, UVA-required extracurricular activities (e.g., competitions or performances), or legitimate academic reasons; requests must be made and approved at least one week in advance. Active participation is expected.

**How you can succeed**: Come to class with a laptop. Read or watch out-of-class material and come prepared with questions and thoughts so you can participate in discussions. Talk to your programming team to make sure you both understand the tasks. Ask questions in class or on the class slack if anything is unclear or if you are getting an error you and your team can’t figure out.

### Homework (30%)

Each week, you will be given assignments that will immerse you in theoretical or practical aspects of computational neuroscience. Almost all of these assignments will involve programming. Programming isn’t just about making sure you’ve closed all your brackets; it’s a new way of thinking, and these problems will give you practice with this type of thinking without your console giving you errors.

**How you can succeed**: Think hard about the problem and how to construct a series of explicit, logical steps that solve it. Write down your best thoughts on the solution, and read through it carefully to catch any leaps of reasoning you’ve made. Your process is more important than whether every step is correct. Remember, there are usually multiple ways to solve any problem.

### Data Exploration (30%)

As part of a semester-long project, you and your programming team will have the opportunity to choose one of the neuroscience data sets we’ll be working with in class. As we discuss various topics in data science, you will be applying these to your data set and building toward a complete research project. Along the way, you and your team will gain expertise on your data set and be a resource for other students in our class interested in working with that type of data. There will be milestones and chances for revision over the course of the semester. Important dates and more detailed information are laid out in the project description.

**How you can succeed**: Engage with the data set you have chosen. Explore the structure of your data set and read the methods section of the associated publication. Think about which methods we discuss can be applied to your data and what kinds of questions could be asked with them. Test and document functions you write to make them as easy as possible for you and the rest of the class to use. Take advantage of peer and instructor feedback to improve your final product.

#### Timeline

- Week 5: Choose a data set that interests you. Describe the experimental conditions and how the data were collected.
- Week 7: Write a module with functions to read raw data from the files in the data set and parse into a flexible data structure.
- Week 10: Develop a question you can answer about your data set (or a comparison between your data set and another) using one or more of the methods we have been working with.
- Week 13: Generate a set of preliminary figures that capture the most important features of your results.
- Week 14: Finalize your analyses and figures. Prepare a short presentation on your results.

## Course policies

Work must be turned in on time to receive full credit. There is a penalty of 5% per day for late work unless an extension is arranged **before** the due date or an emergency prevents submission.

Group work must represent equal effort by all members. If your schedules are not compatible, if there is an emergency or illness, or if you need to come to a different arrangement for splitting the work, contact me so we we can make sure there is an equitable solution that maximizes everyone's opportunity to learn.

Students with COVID-related symptoms or a positive test result within the last 5 days, or who are waiting on test results after a close contact must not attend in person. Notify me to make arrangements for attending virtually. If you are displaying symptoms in class, you will be asked to leave and will lose participation credit for the day.

I don't typically answer email or Slack messages outside of normal working hours. If I do write, I don't expect an immediate response.

My goal is for everyone in the class to have an equal opportunity to learn and
to demonstrate their knowledge. Students with disabilities are entitled to
reasonable accommodations. Contact the Student Disability Access Center
(434-243-5180) for more information or to arrange accommodations.

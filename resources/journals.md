This is a list of journals that publish computational neuroscience research articles.

- [PLoS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/)
- [Neural Computation](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/neco)
- [Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience)
- [Journal of Computational Neuroscience](https://link.springer.com/journal/10827)
- [Biological Cybernetics](https://link.springer.com/journal/422)

In addition, many of the general-purpose neuroscience journals regularly publish articles with a strong computational component, or with large datasets that require sophisticated computational analyses.

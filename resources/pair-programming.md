Pair programming is a collaborative learning technique that helps both novice and experienced programmers deepen the problem-solving skills and strategies needed for effective programming. It is employed widely in  software development and computer science instruction, and may also prove useful in scientific disciplines that make heavy use of programming for data analysis and computational modeling.

Although pair programming may seem to be more effort or less efficient, studies show that it produces better code, reduces development time, and improves awareness of the logic and practices of programming. Some key features of pair programming:

- Both programmers are engaged together in the same process. Pair programming is not breaking a project into smaller parts that are completed independently and then integrated together, but rather working together side by side for almost all of the time.
- Both members of the pair should think of their work as a shared, collaborative project. Each should be able to see their contribution in the final product and take equal ownership of the process that created the product.
- Each member of the pair fills a different role within the process. Sitting side by side at one computer, programmers assume either the role of the **driver** or the **navigator**. Both roles are "programming", both are required for the process, and both should be carried out fully and distinctly. Partners can switch roles and should work to feel comfortable with both roles.
- Pair programming requires open and honest communication. The driver and the navigator must work to balance their abilities to voice their own opinions while being open to their partners' input. This means staying away from "my way or the highway" attitudes, but it also means having the ability to speak up and voice concerns and questions.

## Guidelines and procedures

### Setting

1. Arrange the work space so that you can sit next to each other, with both orienting towards the computer. There should typically be only one laptop open at any time, and both partners' attention should be directed toward it.
2. Planning period. Discuss the task and develop a map of where you are going. For in-class notebooks, the route is more or less laid out for you, but when you get to larger problems within the notebook, stop to discuss the problem and decide how you want to approach it. 
3. Role assignment. Have an initial discussion about who will navigate and who will drive.

### The Driver

1. Controls whatever is being used to record the program.
2. Has responsibility for the details of developing or writing the code (i.e. *entering the code*).
3. Talks aloud about what they are thinking about or why they are entering a particular statement or element. The objective is to make reasoing and thought processes explicit so they can be discussed, rather than leaving them implicit and possibly difficult to understand. This is one key to why pair programming is effective.
4. Responds constructively to feedback given by the navigator. Recognizes that the comments from the navigator are part of the process and does not become annoyed, defensive, or dismissmive. The driver must be open to working out and talking through problems.

### The Navigator

1. Does not enter the code. This is important, especially when the navigator is more experienced than the driver. Ideas need to be talked through rather than simply handing off the keyboard.
2. Keeps a big picture view and thinks strategically about the direction the program is going. Watches and alerts the driver if there are tactical or strategic problems.
3. Asks questions of the driver, especially if the driver is doing something that is unclear, cloudy, or unknown to the navigator. Asks these questions in a a constructive and supportive way, without being overly prescriptive or commanding. Is not afraid to voice ignorance or uncertainty. This is especially important when the navigator is less experienced.
4. Looks for the strategic implications of the developing code. Asks questions about strategy at the appropriate times. Examples: where are we going with this, what does it mean doing it this certain way over another, are we painting ourselves into a corner or losing sight of the broader objective?
6. Thinks of alternatives and looks up resources that may help pursue other ways of solving a problem. This allows the driver to maintain focus on the details while permitting more flexible problem solving. A second computer may be useful for this task, but the navigator must remain focused on the programming process (avoid the temptation to do email, read social media, or browse aimlessly).

## Pair programming in Computational Neuroscience

You will be assigned to pairs based on a survey you complete at the beginning of the semester. These assignments will rotate every two to three weeks throughout the term. Initially you will be assigned to the driver or navigator role but will be free to choose later in the term.

At the end of each pairing, you will be asked to individually submit a brief partner evaluation. 

If you believe your partner is not participating appropriately (e.g., does not come to class prepared to work, does not keep in touch), first address your concerns to your partner. If that approach is not successful, explain the issues to your teaching assistant or the instructor, and we will work with you and your partner to improve the situation. Don't wait until the evaluation; let's try to fix broken group dynamics as soon as possible.
